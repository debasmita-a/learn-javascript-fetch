## learn- javascript-fetch-api
In this repository I have used the JavaScript **fecth()** API to fetch data from some public apis like quote API.
### Goal :
- I want to be able to send a new quote everyday at a certain time to a particular Teams channel/Slack channel/Email etc.
As of now, I am able to display the quote on local server using **Express** JS API.
- I am not using any styles.css or index.html as of now.
- To configure GitHub Action workflow to integrate with Teams workflow and my app.
- 
### NPM Packages used :
- NodeJS
- Express
- Nodemon
